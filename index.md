## About Me üéì

I am a postdoctoral researcher at University of Virginia working with [Tom Hartvigsen](https://www.tomhartvigsen.com/) and [Steven L. Johnson](https://stevenljohnson.org/) . 

 My research interests include various aspects of natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR).

* PhD/MS, Computer Science, [University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMass) ](https://www.umass.edu/), working with James Allan and Negin Rahimi. 
* BS, Computer Science, Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH).
