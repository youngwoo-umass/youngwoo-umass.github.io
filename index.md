## About Me üéì

I am a PhD student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMass) working with [James Allan](https://ciir.cs.umass.edu/~allan/). I am part of the [Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval (CIIR)](http://ciir.cs.umass.edu). My research interests include various aspects of information retrieval (IR) and natural language processing (NLP).

I received my bachelor's degree from Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), where I worked with Hwanjo Yu.
